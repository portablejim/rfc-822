# Build valid RFC-822 dates with plain JavaScript

## To test

Navigate to the root of the project and run:

```bash
node index.js
```

This will log out two examples provided in the code: one date in GMT timezone, and one date in British Summertime
timezone.

Change the example dates in the code to test your own.

## ! Disclaimer on timezones

You may need to add support for your own timezones in the code.
